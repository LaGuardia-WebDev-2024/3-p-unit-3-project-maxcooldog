  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <br> Mix the butter and sugar together for 
2 minutes on medium speed. You want the butter to be fluffy and light.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <br> Add the eggs one at a time to ensure even 
mixing, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed. Then turn the mixer to low speed and add the flour 
slowly, and stop mixing once it’s just incorporated. Over-mixing the batter will give 
you an even denser cake. .
  </p>

<p>
  <strong>NOTE: 
I suggest using a nonstick bundt pan and 
then grease it heavily with butter/shortening or baking spray. This will give you double the insurance that your cake won’t stick. 
    </strong> </p>

  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <br>Bake the cake for 70 – 80 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean. Home ovens can bake differently and vary in temperature, so 
the bake time might need to be adjusted. If it isn’t done on the inside, but you notice the cake 
is getting too brown on top, loosely tent the pan with foil to slow the browning.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <br> You will need 2 loaf pans for this amount of batter. Coat them with baking spray, and line them with parchment paper. This will make removing them from 
the pans easy. I like to spray the parchment again with nonstick spray too. Bake the loafs for 50 – 60 minutes.
